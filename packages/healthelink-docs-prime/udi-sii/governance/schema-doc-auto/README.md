# Automated (generated) Schema Documentation

This directory holds schema documentation that is generated by the
[tbls](https://github.com/k1LoW/tbls) utility.

## Usage

At the CLI run the following command to generate all documentation

```bash
$ cd udi-sii
$ ./udictl.ts governance-docs-sh         # see the command that will be run
$ ./udictl.ts governance-docs-sh | bash  # run the command
```

## TODO

- Because most of our `*.tbls.yaml` files look the same except for a few
  differences, integrate [tbls\-build](https://github.com/k1LoW/tbls-build)
  external subcommand for merging and building `*.tbls.yaml` config files.
- `tbls` support linting to check for comments and other problems,
  [use it](https://github.com/k1LoW/tbls?ref=console.dev#lint).
