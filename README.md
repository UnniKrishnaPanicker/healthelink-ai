## HEALTHeLINK AI Experiments

Welcome to the HEALTHeLINK AI Experiments Prime repository! This repository is the central hub for all code managed for HEALTHeLINK AI Experiment works. Our goal is to maintain a well-organized, scalable, and efficient monorepo that supports our diverse range of projects and technologies.

âœ¨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos Â· Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** âœ¨

### What's Included

- pnpm workspace, whose configuration is stored in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- The monorepo contains two packages located in the packages folder, `healthelink-ai-expr-IaC-prime` and `healthelink-docs-prime`.
- opinionated `prettier` and `eslint` setups.

### Prerequisites

> You'll need to ensure you install the key tools that we're using before you can use this repository. Here are links to the installation guides:
> pnpm - https://pnpm.io/installation

Make sure you have pnpm installed. If not, you can install it globally using:

```
    npm install -g pnpm
```

# Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and manage the monorepo.

#### Clone the Repository

```
    git clone https://github.com/HEALTHeLINK/healthelink-ai.git
    cd healthelink-ai
```

#### Running this project

Running the repository is fairly straight forward, although we're going to use `pnpm` instead of npm or yarn. Therefore once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the root project directory and run:

```
    pnpm install
    npx nx run healthelink.ai_experiment_gpm:dev
    (or)
    pnpm dev
```

This will install the dependencies, and start the web applications, automatically triggering any dependent builds in the process.


#### Infrastructure Setup

### Prerequisites

 Before you begin, make sure you have the Docker,Docker Compose and Git installed on your system

 Run the bash script to install Node and additional packages.

```
bash bootstrap.sh
```

 Create a secrets folder in user home directory

```
  mkdir ~/.secrets.d/
  cp packages/healthelink-ai-expr-IaC-prime/docker/secrets/env.example ~/.secrets.d/healthelink-infra.env
  vim.tiny ~/.secrets.d/healthelink-infra.env [Personalize the values]
```

#### For Docker Installation

```
    pnpm install
    npx nx run healthelink-ai-expr-IaC-prime:docker_deploy
```

#### Running healthelink-ai-expr-IaC-prime

```
    pnpm install
    npx nx run healthelink-ai-expr-IaC-prime:deploy
```

### Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
